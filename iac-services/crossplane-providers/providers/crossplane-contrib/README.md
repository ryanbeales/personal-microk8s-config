This is the only provider configured within crossplane. The Upbound delivered providers didn't work for me but this one did and handles my simple DNS use case for now.

If you want to use it for other objects then the full list of aws objects that can be created is here https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/crossplane-contrib/provider-aws/v0.54.2
